# My NeoVim config files!

Here you can find my neovim workflow alongside an instalation script for future use!
I'm not quite sure that the script works so if you use it its under your responsability...\
To run the script on a unix like system, you need to run the following command and it will install all dependencies (including neovim):
```console
sh install.sh
```
